# os_hardening (Puppet module)

## Description

This module provides secure configuration of your base OS with hardening.

## Requirements

* Puppet

## Parameters

* `system_environment = default`
  define the context in which the system runs. Some options don't work for `docker`/`lxc`
* `desktop_enabled = false`
  true if this is a desktop system, ie Xorg, KDE/GNOME/Unity/etc
* `enable_ipv4_forwarding   = false`
  true if this system requires packet forwarding in IPv4 (eg Router), false otherwise
* `enable_ipv6_forwarding   = false`
  true if this system requires packet forwarding in IPv6 (eg Router), false otherwise
* `enable_ipv6 = false`
* `arp_restricted = true`
  true if you want the behavior of announcing and replying to ARP to be restricted, false otherwise
* `extra_user_paths = []`
  add additional paths to the user's `PATH` variable (default is empty).
* `umask = "027"`
* `password_max_age = 60`
  maximum password age
* `password_min_age = 7`
  minimum password age (before allowing any other password change)
* `auth_retries = 5`
  the maximum number of authentication attempts, before the account is locked for some time
* `auth_lockout_time = 600`
  time in seconds that needs to pass, if the account was locked due to too many failed authentication attempts
* `login_timeout = 60`
  authentication timeout in seconds, so login will exit if this time passes
* `allow_login_without_home = false`
  true if to allow users without home to login
* `passwdqc_enabled = true`
  true if you want to use strong password checking in PAM using passwdqc
* `passwdqc_options = "min=disabled,disabled,16,12,8"`
  set to any option line (as a string) that you want to pass to passwdqc
* `allow_change_user = false`
  if a user may use `su` to change his login
* `enable_module_loading = true`
  true if you want to allowed to change kernel modules once the system is running (eg `modprobe`, `rmmod`)
* `load_modules = []`
  load this modules via initramfs if enable_module_loading is false
* `enable_sysrq = false`
* `enable_core_dump = false`
* `cpu_vendor = 'intel'`
  only required if `enable_module_loading = false`: set the CPU vendor for modules to load
* `root_ttys = ["console","tty1","tty2","tty3","tty4","tty5","tty6"]`
  registered TTYs for root
* `whitelist = []`
  all files which should keep their SUID/SGID bits if set (will be combined with pre-defined whiteliste of files)
* `blacklist = []`
  all files which should have their SUID/SGID bits removed if set (will be combined with pre-defined blacklist of files)
* `remove_from_unknown = false`
  `true` if you want to remove SUID/SGID bits from any file, that is not explicitly configured in a `blacklist`. This will make every Chef run search through the mounted filesystems looking for SUID/SGID bits that are not configured in the default and user blacklist. If it finds an SUID/SGID bit, it will be removed, unless this file is in your `whitelist`.
* `dry_run_on_unknown = false`
  like `remove_from_unknown` above, only that SUID/SGID bits aren't removed. It will still search the filesystems to look for SUID/SGID bits but it will only print them in your log. This option is only ever recommended, when you first configure `remove_from_unkown` for SUID/SGID bits, so that you can see the files that are being changed and make adjustments to your `whitelist` and `blacklist`.

## Usage

After adding this module, you can use the class:

    class { 'os_hardening': }
